# 🐍 My Python Projects

Welcome to my collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python projects. This repository documents my journey of mastering Python through hands-on coding. Each project is self-contained, purpose-driven, and focuses on strengthening specific programming concepts.

## 📁 Project List

### 🎸 Band Name Generator

**File:** `Band_Name_Generator.py`
**Description:** A fun project using string concatenation to create quirky band names based on user input.

### 💰 Tip Calculator

**File:** `Tip_Calculator.py`
**Description:** A simple utility that calculates how much each person should pay after including the tip on a shared bill.

### 🏝️ Treasure Island Game

**File:** `Treasure_Island.py`
**Description:** A text-based adventure game that guides players through a series of decisions in search of treasure. Includes basic conditional logic and input handling.

### 🔒 Password Generator

**File:** `Password_Generator.py`
**Description:** Creates strong, random passwords with user-specified length and complexity using Python's `random` module.

### ✊ Rock Paper Scissors Game

**File:** `Rock_Paper_Scissors_Game.py`
**Description:** A Python implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game against the computer. Covers randomness, input/output, and control flow.

### 🤖 Reborg's World Hurdle Problems

These programs solve challenges from the [Reborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html) platform:

* **Hurdle 1 & 2:** `Reborg_hurdle_1.py`
* **Hurdle 3:** `Reborg_hurdle_3.py`
* **Hurdle 4 (and includes solutions to 1–4):** `Reborg_hurdle_4.py`

These scripts are focused on developing algorithmic thinking using loops, conditionals, and functions.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is part of my goal to complete **100 Python projects**. Each project is intentionally small but impactful, aimed at:

* Improving logic-building skills
* Practicing Python syntax
* Writing clean and modular code
* Gaining confidence with foundational concepts

## 🛠️ How to Run the Projects

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dev-satish/My-Python-Projects.git
   cd My-Python-Projects
   ```

2. **Run a specific Python file:**

   ```bash
   python3 <filename>.py
   ```

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. If not, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


## 🚀 What's Next?

I'm currently working on solving more Reborg's World problems and gradually progressing toward intermediate and advanced Python challenges like:

* Web scraping
* APIs
* GUIs using Tkinter
* Basic automation scripts
* Data handling with pandas and NumPy

Stay tuned as I continue building and learning.
